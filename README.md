# Options Pricing
The purpose of this GIT repository is to provide the basic code used to price options in C++. I have gathered code from online resources and have also created my own. I will try to add time stamps to the changes I make to keep track of when things are being modified. 

I'll accept any feedback regarding the algorithms correctness as well as the code written to implement it.
